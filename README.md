# Skin Cancer Detection AI

## Project Overview

Skin cancer, if not detected early, can be deadly. Many populations lack access to specialized dermatologic care, which exacerbates the issue. Recent advancements in dermoscopy-based AI algorithms have shown promise in aiding clinicians with the diagnosis of melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. However, the ability to triage individuals who need to see a clinician has the potential for even greater impact.

This project aims to leverage a novel dataset of dermatoscope images, captured in a format resembling cell phone photos, to develop AI algorithms that can distinguish between histologically-confirmed malignant and benign skin lesions. The dataset includes images from thousands of patients across three continents, making it ideal for improving early skin cancer detection in non-clinical settings.

## Objectives

- **Develop AI Algorithms:** Create and refine algorithms to differentiate between malignant and benign skin lesions using lower quality images that mimic those captured in primary care or non-clinical settings.
- **Improve Early Detection:** Extend the benefits of automated skin cancer detection to underserved populations, enhancing early diagnosis and disease prognosis.
